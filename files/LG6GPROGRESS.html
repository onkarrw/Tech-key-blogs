            <p>Each generation of wireless communications technology has triggered significant and important social and economic changes. The telegraph, the telephone, microwave relays and satellite medications all made distances effectively smaller and local operations national in scale. Wireless is done the same, with each generation of service offering more bandwidth and faster download speeds, enabling new services to develop by the thousands.</p>
            <p>But each new technology generates a demand for yet more bandwidth, and faster speeds, with less latency. Six G, the next wave of terahertz frequency data transfer, is the next wave. 6G is widely expected to be the critical enabling technology for widespread adoption of VR/AR, the Internet of Things and global scale cloud computing. LG has announced a milestone test of 6G transmission over 320 metres outdoors. The test used hardware developed by LG in association with the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute in Berlin.</p>
            

            <h1><b>How 5G Will Revolutionize Industrial Control</b></h1>
            
            <p>The First Industrial Revolution, taking place between the 1760s and the 1840s, made the transition to industrialized manufacturing with steam power and the cotton gin. The Second Industrial Revolution, which lasted from the late 19 th century to the early 20 th century, introduced electrical power and telephones. The application of electricity to manufacturing processes gave rise to industrial control systems. Combinations of control components—electrical, mechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic—act together in an industrial control system to achieve an objective, such as the production, transportation or generation of material or energy.</p>

            <h1><b>How IIoT Changes Everything</b></h1>
       
            <p>Although the remote management of assets is more convenient and less costly than having staff work on-site, the response to problems may be slow. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and resolve issues in real-time.</p>
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has tremendous capacity in data collection, storage, integration and analytics. Using this capacity, the Industrial IoT (IIoT) is improving interoperability and coordination among different industrial control systems, strengthening their ability to operate in harsh, remote environments.</p>
            <p>Oil rigs, utility grids, wind turbines, airports, railway networks and even cities are looking to the IIoT to reduce costs and improve effectiveness. For example, the IIoT can make the remote monitoring of sites possible to avoid labor-intensive work while increasing safety and efficiency. However, the benefits the IIoT can deliver depend on network speed and performance.</p>
